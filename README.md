Studies by Jobscan and Harvard Business School indicate that over 90% of large companies use technology such as an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to review, filter, and rank candidates based on skills, experience, and other pre-set criteria. Industry statistics show that less than 25% of résumés pass these automated systems. Many viable candidates may get filtered out because they do not match the criteria the recruiter is seeking. As a result, University Career Centers recommend [ATS-friendly formatting](https://capd.mit.edu/resources/make-your-resume-ats-friendly/) and tailoring résumés to each job. While formatting tips are easily communicated and achievable, students find it harder to understand how to ensure that their qualifications are highlighted to fit the job. [***curriculum***vit.ai](https://cvai.seshan.org/) is free AI-powered platform for use by Career Center professionals as well as students to:

1. Analyze the job descriptions for the employer’s criteria and examine specific verbiage used.
2. Review a résumé and look for matching skills and criteria in context.
3. Provide a match score and tangible recommendations for improvement to identify missing skills that a student may have forgotten or need to further develop.
